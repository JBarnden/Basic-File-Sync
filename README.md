# Basic File Sync
### v0.1.0

#### Author: James Barnden

## Description
Cross-platform File Sync program that copies source file (from file) to the destination file (to file) when changes are detected.
This is a hugely basic, quickly written version that needs some serious improving.  It's currently limited to working
only with single files.

## To use
To use the application, just run it from your CLI
`python FileSync.py`

This was written in Python 3 and has not been checked for backwards compatibility with Python 2.

In future I hope to support:
- Multiple to & from files 
- menu for saving and loading configuration and an application
- maintained, user accessible log.
- Support for directories
